The Animation has mainly three requirements:
Animation Controller:
Manage Animation, Listen For updates and Manipulate Animation

Animation known as Tween:
Defines the begin and end value with how to move beginning to the end through a curve. Default curve is linear which means every frame increase by exact same amount.
Object will notify the controller through listenable protocal whenever its value has changed.

Ticker Class:
Class that listens to the frame callback and calls a tick function that passes the elapsed duration between the current frame and the last frame to the ticker listener.
In our case ticker listener is the controller
